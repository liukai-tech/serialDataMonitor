# Serial Data Monitor

![serialDataMonitor](small.gif)

## Description

Serial Data Monitor is a multiplatform (Windows, Linux, Mac, ...) tool to interactively receive/edit/monitor data and send commands to an embedded system via the serial bus. It is fast, real time (the embedded system is the master) and proudly made with Godot Engine. The language used is C#. This tool is already used in production but has (for sure) some bugs to discover. Also the MAC version has not tested since I don't have a MAC, so developpers are welcome.

## Table of Contents

The *host* folder contains all the development files
The *ecu* folder contains an example of a bare metal application for a microcontroler and also the .ini file for the application
The *binaries* folder contains the application for various platforms. See the related README files

## Installation

Download the zip file for your platform, unzip on a folder of your choice and execute the application. 

## Usage

The next section is usage, in which you instruct other people on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action.

## Contributing

This project is just out of foundry, it can be enhanced in several ways, ideas and contributors welcomed.

## Credits

Thanks to Godot Engine developpers who have done this excellent (for me the best without doubt) multiplatform development tool.
